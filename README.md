Hi, I’m @michaelberks a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Manchester, currently working in the Quantitative Biomedical Imaging (QBI) Laboratory.

I have a background in computer vision, particularly as applied to medical imaging processing.

I manage the QBI Lab's code-base, and in particular, Madym, an open source C++ toolkit for quantitative DCE-MRI analysis. Main development for Madym takes place on our lab's [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/manchester_qbi/manchester_qbi_public/madym_cxx), however the repository is also push-mirrored to my personal GitHub account [here](https://github.com/michaelberks/madym_cxx).

Contact information and details of my research and teaching can be found on:
